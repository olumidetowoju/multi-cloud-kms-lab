# AWS Day 5 – Database Encryption Lab

This lab configures **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** encrypted with a **KMS CMK**, stores the admin password in **Secrets Manager**, and shows how apps connect securely.

## What you’ll do
1. Create a KMS key for database encryption.
2. Deploy RDS PostgreSQL with that CMK.
3. Store admin credentials in Secrets Manager.
4. (Optional) Verify encryption + connect over TLS.
